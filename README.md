# WebAPI Challenge - Javascript Quiz

## **Description**

This was the second Javascript project we were given and I felt a LOT more comfortable coding with Javascript than the last project. This was still quite a challenge though. I put in about 10 hours or more into completing this so I hope you enjoy it!
